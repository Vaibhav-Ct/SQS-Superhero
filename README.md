# SQS Superhero Service

## Overview

`SQS Superhero Service` is a Spring Boot-based application that manages superhero data and leverages Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for handling asynchronous message processing. The service includes functionalities to add, update, delete, and query superhero records while efficiently managing message queues for real-time updates.

## Features

- **AWS SQS Integration**: Uses AWS SQS for decoupled messaging and asynchronous processing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Offers endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting superhero records.
- **Spring Boot Powered**: Utilizes Spring Boot for streamlined application setup and deployment.
- **RESTful API**: Accessible interfaces for smooth interaction with the application.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- AWS Account with access to SQS
- Configured AWS CLI or AWS SDK with necessary credentials

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash

    ```properties
    aws.sqs.queue.url=your_sqs_queue_url
    aws.sqs.region=your_aws_region
    ```

4. **Build and Run the Application**

    If you are using Maven, run:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
